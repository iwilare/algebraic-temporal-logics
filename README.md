## Algebraic Temporal Logics

This repository contains the Agda presentation of a quantified linear temporal logic QLTL which can reason on the temporal evolution of any multi-sorted algebra (e.g. (directed) graphs, tree-like structures). The logic is based on the counterpart paradigm (in the sense of Lewis) to capture the evolution of individual elements of the algebraic structure between worlds/instants of time.

## Requirements
