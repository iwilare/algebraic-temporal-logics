## Categorical semantics for counterpart-based temporal logics

This repository contains the Agda presentation of the categorical semantics for a quantified linear temporal logic QLTL based on counterpart semantics in the sense of Lewis.

We use the [agda-categories](https://github.com/agda/agda-categories) library as a practical foundation to construct the models of our logic by means of relational presheaves. 

## Positive normal form

Some results on a positive normal form of this logic in the case of linear trace-like models can be found at [https://github.com/iwilare/qltl-pnf/](https://github.com/iwilare/qltl-pnf/).

## Requirements

- `agda-categories` 1.7
- `agda-stdlib` 1.7.1
- `agda` 2.6.2.2
